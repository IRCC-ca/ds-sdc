# React Stencil example

This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
and demonstrates how to setup IRCC-ca/ds-sdc-react  with React via the `@ircc-ca/ds-sdc-react` package. The main
file to look at is [`App.tsx`](./src/App.tsx).

## Usage

```
cd examples/react-stencil
npm install
npm run start
```

You can also launch the react-stencil project from the root `npm run start:react`
