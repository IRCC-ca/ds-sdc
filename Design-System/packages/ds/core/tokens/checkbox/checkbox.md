# Checkbox styles

## Usage

### Selectors

```html
<input type="checkbox" />
```

### Attributes

#### Size

Defaults to the configured size at the application level. `size="large"` in the default theme.

This attribute defines the width and height size to inherit for the checkbox. This can be overridden at the instance level, though it is not recommended, as follows:

<input type="checkbox" size="setting" />
```
